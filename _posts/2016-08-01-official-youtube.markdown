#The official YouTube for QuickScythe has been released!!

After creating the server Eridauni, and working with the popular Minecraft Server 'MineSwine', it seems logical that I would want to expand myself more, and that's exactly what I have done. 

I have created a YouTube channel to upload all kinds of videos from vlogs, to gaming videos, and even community suggested videos. I have already uploaded a few vlogs and a few other videos, but I haven't been able to upload anything else recently. I am still working out a schedule to upload videos. As I have school, and work with 'MineSwine' and 'Eridauni', I don't have much time to edit and upload videos every day, so while I am in school, I will try to upload twice a week, and during breaks I will try to upload anywhere from every day, to at least 4 times a week. As I stated earlier, I am open to community suggested videos, so be sure to comment on my channel, and tell me what you think I should upload next! Below are links to all of my social media outlets, and servers I have mentioned in this post:
