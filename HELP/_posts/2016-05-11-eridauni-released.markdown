#Eridauni has officially be released in Beta

You can play and become a Beta Tester! Come join the server at [Eridauni.nitrous.it]() and play a while. Be sure to tell me or other staff about any bugs you come across as you will be rewarded!
There are multiple plans for this server, but right now only survival can be played. Some of the plans for the server include
```
- A gamemode called Elismith, an RPG
- A server dedicated to minigames
- Many things to do on the Hub server
```
The server is still deeply in development and there are many more things coming. Be sure to tell me or other staff about any bugs or glitches you encounter on the server to be sure to make the game as fair as possible, and remember you will be rewarded for reporting bugs.
